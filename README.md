# rpg48

I'm making a game in 48 hours. This is the repo for it. You can find more info on my blog: https://thelastpointer.wordpress.com/48-hour-rpg/

### Setup ###

I used Unity **2017.1.0f3**. Check out the repo and open it with Unity. Should work with newer (and some older) versions, but no promises.
